I am trying to set up the Cognito SDK in our Angular project.

I'm starting with the "Identity SDK for Javascript"

    "npm install --save-dev webpack json-loader"
    "npm install --save amazon-cognito-identity-js"

        I ran both of these in the root-directory of the project

    Next, I am supposed to add a file called "webpack.config.js"

        It appears, however, that Angular already created this file

        Although the contents are very different

    Then, I am to create an empty file "entry.js" in the "src" directory (also created by angular)

        This file is referenced in the "webpack" file in the instructions,
        but Angular's "webpack" references a different file, also in "src", which already exists

        So, for now, I think I'll just leave both of these files as is, and not create "entry.js"

    Finally, I was supposed to add a "build" script to "package.json", but, once again, one was already there.

        So I'll also leave this file as-is, and just see if this works


I'll be putting all the logic in "dashboard.component.ts",
since that's where the Cognito login-page redirects

The server wouldn't start because "require" couldn't be found

    "npm install @types/node --save-dev"

    and then adding "node" to "types in "tsconfig.app.json" fixed it.

    

NOTE: I have yet to touch "Auth SDK for Javascript"
